# MpesaFlow OpenAPI Specs

This repo contains MpesaFlow's public OpenAPI specs. These specs are used to generate our [documentation](https://docs.mpesaflow.coom/api-reference).

This repo is not meant to be contributed to directly, as the specs are synced either manually or via CI from an internal repository. If you are a MpesaFlow employee and are looking to make changes to the OpenAPI specs, please bring this up internally and someone will point you to the correct repo where the source of the specs are generated. If you are an external contributor looking to make adjustments or fixed, please open an issue!
